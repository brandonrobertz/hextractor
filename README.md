# Hextractor - HTML Data Extraction Playground

This is a little utility for testing, building and visualizing [Hext](https://hext.thomastrapp.com/) templates. It's a companion to my ["Scraping a Hostile Web"](TK) blog post.

NOTE: If you're looking for the deprecated [Workbench](https://github.com/CJWorkbench/cjworkbench) module, see the [hextractor-workbench](https://github.com/brandonrobertz/hextractor/tree/hextractor-workbench) branch.
